# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

An AI-native interactive textbook for teaching Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, featuring cutting-edge technologies and hands-on learning experiences.

## 🎯 Course Overview

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the **physical world**. This comprehensive course introduces **Physical AI**—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. You'll learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using industry-standard tools like ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac.

### What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence with the physical world. Unlike traditional AI that operates purely in digital environments, Physical AI systems:

- **Understand Physics**: Comprehend gravity, friction, collisions, and other physical laws
- **Perceive Reality**: Use sensors (cameras, LiDAR, IMUs) to understand their environment
- **Manipulate Objects**: Interact with the physical world through actuators and end-effectors
- **Navigate Space**: Plan paths, avoid obstacles, and move through 3D environments
- **Learn from Experience**: Improve performance through interaction with the real world
